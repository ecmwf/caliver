Description: Utility functions for the post-processing, calibration and
  validation of grid model outputs. Initial test cases include the outputs of
  the following forest fire models: GEFF and RISICO. The package is
  described in Vitolo et al. (2018) "Caliver: An R package for CALIbration and
  VERification of forest fire gridded model outputs"
