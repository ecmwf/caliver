\title{Merge netcdf files on the time dimension}
\usage{
catNetcdf(inDir = NULL, varname = NULL, startingString = "",
  recursive = FALSE, outFileName = "outfile.nc", outDir = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{inDir}{is the directory where all the files to read are stored}

\item{varname}{name of the variable to extract}

\item{startingString}{string defining the beginning of the netcdf filenames (needed to exclude other files)}

\item{recursive}{logical (TRUE by default). If set to TRUE it looks in folders and subfolders}

\item{outFileName}{output filename}

\item{outDir}{is the directory where outFileName is saved, by default this is the working directory.}
}
