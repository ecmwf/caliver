**caliver** is a package developed for the R programming language. The name stands for **cal**Ibration and **ver**ification of gridded models. Although caliver was initially designed for wildfire danger models such as GEFF (developed by ECMWF) and RISICO (developed by CIMA Research Foundation), the algorithms can be applied to any gridded model output. Caliver is available with an APACHE-2 license.

## Installation
The installation of the caliver package depends on the following libraries:

* Geospatial Data Abstraction Library ([GDAL](https://gdal.org/))
* NetCDF4 ([netcdf4](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/))

Make sure you have the above libraries installed before attempting to install caliver.
Once all the dependencies are installed, get caliver's development version from github using [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools):

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ecmwf/caliver")
```

Alternatively, the stable version of this package is available on CRAN and can be installed as shown below.

``` r
install.packages("caliver")
```

Load the package:

``` r
library("caliver")
```

## Docker
In this repository you find a Dockerfile that contains all the necessary dependencies and the caliver package already installed.

```
docker build -t ecmwf/caliver:latest -f Dockerfile .
```

Alternatively, you can use the image we host on docker hub:
```
docker run -it --rm ecmwf/caliver:latest bash
```
